## Posse Namesakes

Curious who the posses are named after? Here's your primer:

### Berners Lee
Professor Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist, best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. Berners-Lee is also the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the Web's continued development.

### Brooks
Frederick Phillips Brooks, Jr. is an American computer architect, software engineer, and computer scientist, best known for managing the development of IBM's System/360 family of computers and the OS/360 software support package, then later writing candidly about the process in his seminal book The Mythical Man-Month. Brooks has received many awards, including the National Medal of Technology in 1985 and the Turing Award in 1999.

### Goldberg
Adele Goldberg is best known for her work with Alan Kay and others in developing the object-oriented computing language Smalltalk in the 1970s and 1980s. Smalltalk was one of the most influential programming languages -- virtually all object-oriented languages that came after were influenced by it. The Smalltalk language and environment were tremendously influential in the history of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) user interface.

### Golick
James Golick, a well-known figure in the Ruby community, CTO of Normal, friend to many, master of the headstand and self-proclaimed computologist was an outspoken advocate for women in technology. He believed that working on open source was a path to success in the software industry and a great way for women to advance their careers.

### Hopper
Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral. She invented the first compiler for a computer programming language, and was one of those who popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages which led to the development of COBOL. She is credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches (because she actually found a moth in a computer).

### Kay
Alan Curtis Kay is an American computer scientist best known for his pioneering work on object-oriented programming. He conceived the Dynabook concept which defined the conceptual basics for laptop and tablet computers and E-books, and is the architect of the modern overlapping windowing graphical user interface (GUI).

### Knuth
Donald Ervin Knuth is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms". He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.

### Lovelace
Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.

### Matsumoto
Yukihiro Matsumoto, a.k.a. Matz, is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of Ruby. His demeanor has brought about a motto in the Ruby community "Matz is nice and so we are nice," commonly abbreviated as MINASWAN.

### Ritchie
Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie was an American computer scientist. He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system. Ritchie and Thompson received the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983.

### Weirich
James Nolan "Jim" Weirich was well known in the software industry as a developer, speaker, teacher, and contributor to the Ruby Programming Language community. Among his many contributions he created Rake, the most widely downloaded Ruby Gem, downloaded more than 74 million times.

### Zygmuntowicz
Ezra Zygmuntowicz was a founder of the rails hosting company Engine Yard and original developer of the web framework Merb, a model–view–controller web framework in Ruby, notable as a precursor to Rails 3.
